Report: Multiaccount - [RTZ2] Tyche and [BS.] Guesswhat

[RTZ2] Tyche is the main account; [BS.] Guesswhat is the side account what aids Tyche.

Evidence 1: [BS.] Guesswhat keeps settling by [RTZ2], repeatedly, even though [BS.] Guesswhat was zeroed repeatedly: https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/Tyche_and_Guesswhat.png; https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/Guesswhat_keeps_settling_by_Tyche.png

Evidence 2: [RTZ2] Tyche and [BS.] Guesswhat sent hero to conquer an oasis around the same time, for Tyche's benefit: https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/071429_Tyche_attacking_oasis.png; https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/071431_Guesswhat_attacking_oasis.png

Evidence 3: After the attack specified in 2, [RTZ2] Tyche must have tried to conquer the same oasis from [BS.] Guesswhat; he could not finish on time, and as a result, player [CS-2] superwudi was able to snipe the last hit of the oasis - remember, [CS-2] superwudi only went to raid the oasis ONCE: https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/074835_superwudi_hitting_only_once_and_scoring_last_hit_from_Guesswhat.png

Evidence 4: [RTZ2] Tyche and [BS.] Guesswhat sent hero to conquer an oasis around the same time again, for Tyche's benefit: https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/074900_Guesswhat_attacking_oasis.png; https://github.com/Pylonight/TR-Reports/blob/main/ts6.x1.america/Tyche/074915_Tyche_attacking_oasis.png
